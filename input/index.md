Title: TestCentric Cake Recipe
---
TestCentric.Cake.Recipe is the standard cake recipe used for TestCentric projects. It is inspired by Cake.Recipe but is somewhat simpler in implementation, since it isn't intended for general use.

The recipe assists the programmer in creating a build script, which follows certain conventions adopted by the TestCentric project. To a certain extent, it enforces those conventions. The general idea is to make it easy to do the right thing.

For that reason, the script may not be directly useful outside of the TestCentric project. However, since it is open source, released under the MIT license, it's possible to copy and adapt it for use in any organization.

This site provides [documentation](/docs) for using the recipe.
